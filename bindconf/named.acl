// CONFIGME 
// You can name groups of CIDRs here, whatever helps you remember 
// such as groups named by location or a particular customer
// or purpose that you might want to add or remove as a group
// or assign certain permissions to as a group
// These acl group names can be used anywhere in the 
// named options files

// REMOVE 1.2.3.4/32 and replace with your own masters (IPs you get other peoples zones from)
// and laves (IPs you allow to copy your zones)

// Add your own IPs to client_networks (IPs you will test this RPZ server from)
// and superadmin_networks (IPs you want to give more admin access to beyond making recursive requests)

// Example showing multiple IPs in an acl group:
// acl "foo" { 1.2.3.0/24; 1.2.3.4; 4.3.0.0/16 };

acl "myresolvers" { 1.2.3.4/32; 4.3.2.1/32; };

acl "mytrustedfriends;" { 1.2.3.4/32; };

acl "ixfr_masters" { 1.2.3.4/32; };

acl "ixfr_slaves" { 1.2.3.4/32; };

acl "superadmin_networks" { 127.0.0.1; };
